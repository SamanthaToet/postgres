# GDI Intro to Databases - 4 part workshop

## Part I: Intro & Data modeling

### What are databases?

System built to store, organize, and retrieve data. 

Types: hierarchical, relational, non-relational, object-oriented, etc.

SQL = structured query language

A *database management system* manages data efficiently and allows for multiple users to access (version control)

### What is data modeling?

Conceptual models - high level domain models
Logical models - logical entities and relationships 

Entities (person, place, or thing) with attributes (data)

Primary key - the attribute used to id a specific entity (must be unique!)

Remember:

Arrays are lists of variables

Objects are key value pairs 

**Why would you choose a certain type of database? EX. MongoDB vs. MySQL?**

Ask yourself "what does something have to have at minimum to be this type of thing?"
